## ⚙️ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/otieno-backend/Task_Management_API.git

cd Task_Management_API
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

### 3. Activate the virtual environment

#### Windows

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### Linux/macOS

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 4. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Run database migrations

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### 6. Start the development server

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

The API will be available at:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

## 🔐 Authentication

The API uses token-based authentication.

After authentication, include the token in API requests:

```text
Authorization: Token YOUR_TOKEN
```

Authenticated users can access and manage their tasks according to the application's permissions.

## API Documentation

The API uses token authentication for protected endpoints.

### Base URL

```text
https://task-management-api-wpw5.onrender.com/api/
```

### Authentication

Protected endpoints require a token in the request header:

```text
Authorization: Token YOUR_TOKEN
```

---

## Authentication Endpoints

### Register a User

**POST** `/api/register/`

Create a new user account.

#### Request

```json
{
  "username": "brian",
  "email": "brian@example.com",
  "password": "yourpassword"
}
```

#### Response

```json
{
  "message": "User created successfully",
  "token": "YOUR_TOKEN",
  "user": {
    "id": 1,
    "username": "brian",
    "email": "brian@example.com"
  }
}
```

### Login

**POST** `/api/login/`

Authenticate a user and receive an API token.

#### Request

```json
{
  "username": "brian",
  "password": "yourpassword"
}
```

#### Response

```json
{
  "message": "Login successful",
  "token": "YOUR_TOKEN",
  "user": {
    "id": 1,
    "username": "brian",
    "email": "brian@example.com"
  }
}
```

### Logout

**POST** `/api/logout/`

Logs out the authenticated user and removes their authentication token.

```text
Authorization: Token YOUR_TOKEN
```

#### Response

```json
{
  "message": "Logged out successfully"
}
```

---

## Task Endpoints

All task endpoints require authentication.

### List Tasks

**GET** `/api/tasks/`

Returns tasks belonging to the authenticated user.

```bash
curl -X GET https://task-management-api-wpw5.onrender.com/api/tasks/ \
  -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_TOKEN"
```

### Create a Task

**POST** `/api/tasks/`

Create a new task.

#### Request

```json
{
  "title": "Complete Django API project",
  "description": "Finish API documentation and testing",
  "due_date": "2026-10-01T10:00:00Z",
  "priority": "HIGH",
  "status": "PENDING",
  "recurrence": "NONE"
}
```

A category can be assigned using `category_id`:

```json
{
  "title": "Complete Django API project",
  "description": "Finish API documentation",
  "priority": "HIGH",
  "status": "PENDING",
  "recurrence": "NONE",
  "category_id": 1
}
```

The authenticated user is automatically assigned to the task.

### Get a Single Task

**GET** `/api/tasks/{id}/`

Example:

```text
GET /api/tasks/1/
```

### Update a Task

**PATCH** `/api/tasks/{id}/`

Example:

```json
{
  "status": "IN_PROGRESS"
}
```

Tasks that are already completed have restricted updates.

### Delete a Task

**DELETE** `/api/tasks/{id}/`

Example:

```text
DELETE /api/tasks/1/
```

### Complete a Task

**PATCH** `/api/tasks/{id}/complete/`

Marks a task as completed and records the completion time.

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://task-management-api-wpw5.onrender.com/api/tasks/1/complete/ \
  -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_TOKEN"
```

For recurring tasks, completing a task can automatically create the next task based on its recurrence setting.

```

---

## Filtering

Tasks support filtering by status, priority, due date, and category.

### Filter by Status

```text
/api/tasks/?status=COMPLETED
```

### Filter by Priority

```text
/api/tasks/?priority=HIGH
```

### Filter by Due Date

```text
/api/tasks/?due_date=2026-10-01
```

### Filter by Category ID

```text
/api/tasks/?category=1
```

### Filter by Category Name

```text
/api/tasks/?category=Work
```

### Combine Filters

```text
/api/tasks/?status=PENDING&priority=HIGH
```

---

## Ordering

Tasks support ordering by `due_date` and `priority`.

### Order by Due Date

```text
/api/tasks/?ordering=due_date
```

### Reverse Due Date Order

```text
/api/tasks/?ordering=-due_date
```

### Order by Priority

```text
/api/tasks/?ordering=priority
```

### Reverse Priority Order

```text
/api/tasks/?ordering=-priority
```

If no supported ordering parameter is provided, tasks are ordered by newest first.

---

## Category Endpoints

Categories are linked to the authenticated user.

### List Categories

**GET** `/api/categories/`

### Create Category

**POST** `/api/categories/`

#### Request

```json
{
  "name": "Work"
}
```

### Get a Category

**GET** `/api/categories/{id}/`

Example:

```text
GET /api/categories/1/
```

### Update a Category

**PATCH** `/api/categories/{id}/`

```json
{
  "name": "Personal"
}
```

### Delete a Category

**DELETE** `/api/categories/{id}/`

---

## Task Workflow

Tasks support four statuses:

```text
PENDING → IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETED
```

A task can also be marked:

```text
CANCELLED
```

When a task is completed, the API records the `completed_at` timestamp.

Completed tasks have restricted updates to help preserve completion data.

---

## Recurring Tasks

Tasks support four recurrence options:

* `NONE`
* `DAILY`
* `WEEKLY`
* `MONTHLY`

Example:

```json
{
  "title": "Weekly project review",
  "description": "Review project progress",
  "priority": "MEDIUM",
  "status": "PENDING",
  "recurrence": "WEEKLY"
}
```

When a recurring task is completed, the API calculates the next due date and creates the next pending task.

---

## User Dashboards

### User Dashboard

**GET** `/api/user/dashboard/`

Requires authentication.

### Admin Dashboard

**GET** `/api/admin/dashboard/`

Requires authentication and the appropriate administrative permissions.

---

## Testing

The project includes automated tests covering areas such as:

* User authentication
* Task creation
* Task status changes
* Task completion
* Recurring tasks
* Category filtering
* Status filtering
* Priority filtering
* Task ordering

Run the tests with:

```bash
pytest -v
```

---

## Example Authentication Flow

### 1. Register

```text
POST /api/register/
```

### 2. Copy the returned token

```text
"token": "YOUR_TOKEN"
```

### 3. Add the token to protected requests

```text
Authorization: Token YOUR_TOKEN
```

### 4. Access the task API

```text
GET /api/tasks/
```

This allows an authenticated user to manage their own tasks.
